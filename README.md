Domotic App
=============================

Description

The app is desinged for Android devices and it's meant to communicate with an Arduino device over internet
so you can control some features of your intelligent house.

The communication is very simple because it's made with params in the URL. This project contains just the client side code.
The communication is through the [Hardvolk](http://hardvolk.com) server but it's easy to replace for the server of your choice in the app.js file.

This project has the core based on the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) and the tool used to code the app 
was [Intel XDK Overview](http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/xdkdocs).
